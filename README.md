# DS-301-RL-on-Games
DS-301 final project on reinforcement learning on tactic shooting simulation


## About this project
The project aims to train double agents in deep reinforcement learning with DQN to perform tactical shooting tasks in 2D and 3D simulation environments built with OpenAI Gym.
This Project has 2 main parts:
- The train folder to train DQN agents in our 3D and 2D environments:
    - Within ./train/Env folder there is env.py (This is where all the environment classes are stored)
    - Within ./train/agent folder there is agent.py (This is where we have the DQN Neural Network class and the DQAgent which is where the Neural Network is implemented to have replay and memory)
    - Within ./train/agent folder there is also schedule.py (This is where the hyperparameter scheduling schemes were specified)
- The notebooks folder which contains all the notebooks where all the tests and tuning were done for this project
