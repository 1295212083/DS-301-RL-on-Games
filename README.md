# DS-301-RL-on-Games
DS-301 final project on reinforcement learning on tactic shooting games


This Project has 2 main parts:
- The train folder to train DQN agents in our 3D and 2D environments:
    - Within Env folder there is env.py (This is where all the environment classes are stored)
    - Within agent folder there is agent.py (This is where we have the DQN Neural Network class and the DQAgent which is where the Neural Network is implemented to have replay and memory)
    - Within agent folder there is also schedule.py (This is where the hyperparameter scheduling schemes were specified)
- The notebooks folder which contains all the notebooks where all the tests and tuning were done for this project
